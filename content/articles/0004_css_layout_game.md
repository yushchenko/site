Positioning of elements on the page using CSS layout properties can be a tricky business and
there's only one way to master it: practice, practice and practice.
Reading books and articles will be quite useless without creating and playing with tens and hundreds of own examples.
Most of the exercises are primitive,
as usual, it's just a page with a couple of divs and several styles applied to them.

To simplify the process I have created an application that allows to create simple markup and apply styles on fly.
As for me, it's more fast and convenient to see results of the changes immediately
than hit refresh after every change on the page.

The application called "CSS Layout Game" is located [here][app].
Thanks to jQuery library it contains only a bit more than one hundred lines of JavaScript code.
The first version provides bare minimum of functions: you can add new elements and change their layout properties.
I think, that's enough for the most of examples.
There are no way to save created layout so every page refresh starts the game from the beginning.
But practice makes it perfect, isn't it? So lets keep things simple.

Play, learn, enjoy and make the Web better :)
