<h2>[Jul 10 2010] Site from Scratch 0: Introduction</h2>
<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>I have been thinking about having own place in the Internet for many years.
Time was coming but the dream remained just a dream probably because it had never been the real necessity for me.
On the other hand, building of a site it's a big pile of problems for an unprepared person. 
One needs, for example, to register a domain, find a hosting, develop or adopt a site engine and so on so on.
This long list is limited only by creator's ambitions and imagination.</p>
<p>Why all, why not to use existing solutions?
There are many fashionable Web 2.0 services which let us create and publish content.
Hundreds and thousands blog spots, wikis, social networks allow to share your writing, pictures, links, contacts...
Seems very simple but everything comes with its own price.</p>
<p>The first and the most important concern is lack of control.
Let imagine, I've established a blog on <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger.com</a>.
The first my questions would be how to remove this ugly header from my pages.
I clearly understand that it's a part of the app but I simply don't want to have it up on my writings...
It could sound weird but as a developer I want fully control what my reader's browser gets from the site.
Probably it's due to hate to bloated software in general and bloated web sites in particular.</p>
<p>Next, every service has its own limitations. 
For instance, using blog it's extremely easy to publish articles and share photos.
But what should be done if I want to create a small JavaScript application to enrich my developer's portfolio? 
Use another service and link it? But I want put it <em>inside</em> my last article...</p>
<p>It could sound a bit strange but it's looks like that I'm willing to spend my time to get <em>exactly</em> what I want.
Not more but not less.</p>
<p>There are two ways to do so.
The first one is usage of an existing solution such as CMS, blog engine or framework.
Spend more or less time for studying, set up and configuration, customization and fixing of strange bugs...
It's a usual way how we do things done at work, isn't it?
And this approach works really good while the solution is used how it was thought by its creator.
A step aside costs much more than ten or even hundred steps forward.
So it's crucial to choose the right solution that fits one's needs as close as it's possible.
But right now I don't know precisely what I want to create.
This reason leads me to the second way - to create own solution from blank sheet.</p>
<p>The last but not the least thing is the simple fact that creation something from scratch can be extremely interesting.
Unfortunately or not, but it rarely happens when a programmer gets opportunity to create something on his own mind at work.
So I'm going to have a great fun developing at least my website.</p>
<h3>The Requirements</h3>
<p>The major requirement is simplicity.
The simplest implementation is the best.
For example, the most widespread way of data representation is text format.
Why? Because it's simple.
So I'm going to keep all stuff editable in Emacs (you can replace it with your favorite editor)
unless it's really impractical (images is a good example).
By the way, storing an article in text allows to see diffs (using a VCS is a good habit),
have several versions of the text and easily or even automatically merge them and use grep and other utils.
It also helps keep my mind healthy because minimizes usage of M$ Word or other products
created for such called 'stupid users'.
Binary formats and databases are great only when they are used on proper place.</p>
<p>So let keep everything simple including this 'requirements' and let space for creativity.</p>
<h3>The Technologies</h3>
<p>On client side life's simple.
I need only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No Flash. No SilverLight.
Keep it simple and it will work everywhere.
There is a space for usage of an appropriate JavaScript library, for example jQuery, to not reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>On server-side there are much more options. Let's narrow it.
First of all, I love dynamic languages.
It's a pain to switch between dynamic (JavaScript) and static (e.g. C# or Java) languages all the time.
For small application written by one person client and server sides should fit well.
Next, the language should be stable and have plenty of libraries.
Writing the one hundred first implementation of RSS is not so exiting.
And at the end, I'm too lazy to study a new language especially for project.
So there is only one candidate at the rest, it's <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> programming language.</p>
<p>There is also problem with hosting. 
I'm definitely not a system administrator, love rather to create than thinker stuff.
So I would like to have set up and trouble-free hosting.
I thought that it's just illusion until I find <a href="https://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a>.
It's a great example of solving problem adding extra level of abstraction.
In this case, it's abstraction between me as a developer and the hosting.
And it supports Python as first class citizen so no way to escape, I'm catch.</p>
<h3>What next?</h3>
<p>The answer is easy, as long way starts form the first step as a site begins form the first page.</p>
