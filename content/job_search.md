Hello,

I'm an experienced Software Engineer with strong passion towards JavaScript and Web technologies,
currently looking for a challenging job in Sydney, Australia.

Last years of development in JavaScript only gave me deep understanding of this beautiful language.
I was caught by its conceptual simplicity combined with exceptional flexibility and
strongly believe that the period when JavaScript has been considered as a 'toy language' is over
and in near feature it will shine not only in browsers but in many other areas.

In my humble opinion, the best recommendation for a programmer is his or her code,
so I will kindly ask you take a look at my last open source project that lives [here on GitHub][formEngine.js].

My CV is located [here][cv].
You can download it in a convenient format
using the following links: [doc][cv.doc], [pdf][cv.pdf], [odt][cv.odt].


Sincerely yours, <br />
Valery Yushchenko
