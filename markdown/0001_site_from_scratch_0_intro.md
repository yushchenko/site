## [Jul .. 2010] Site from Scratch 0: Introduction

### The Idea

I have been thinking about having my own place in the Internet for many years.
Time was comming but the dream remained just a dream probably because it had never been the real necessity for me.
On the other hand, building of a site it's a big pale of problems for an unprepared person. 
One needs, for example, to register a domain, find a hosting, develop or adopt an engine and so on so on.
This long todo list is limited only by creator's ambitions and imagination.

First of all, why not to use existing solutions?
There are many fasionable such called Web 2.0 services which let us create and publish content.
Handreds and thousands blog spots, wikis, social networks allow to share your writing, pictures, links, contacts...
Seems very simple but everything comes with it's own price.

The first and the most important concern is lack of control.
Let imagine, I've established a blog on [blogger.com](http://www.blogger.com).
The first my questions would be how to remove this ugly header from my pages.
I clearly understand that it's a part of the app but I simply don't want to have it up on my writings...
It could sound weird but as a developer I want fully control what my reader's browser gets from the site.
Probably it's due to hate to bloated software in general and bloated web sites in particular.

Next, every service has its own limitations. 
For instance, using blog it's extremely easy to publish articles and share photos.
But what should be done if I want to create a small JavaScript application to enrich my developer's portfolio? 
Use another service and link it? But I want put it *inside* my last article...

It could sound a bit strange but it's looks like like that I'm willing to spend my time to get *exactly* what I want.
Not more but not less.

The last but not the least thing is the simple fact that creation something from scatch can be extremely interesting.
Unfortunatelly or not, but it rarely happens when a programmer gets oportunity to create something on his own mind at work.
So I'm going to have a great fun developing at least my own web site.
