<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm an experienced Software Engineer with strong passion towards JavaScript and Web technologies,
currently looking for a challenging job in Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>Last years of development in JavaScript only gave me deep understanding of this beautiful language.
I was caught by its conceptual simplicity combined with exceptional flexibility and
strongly believe that the period when JavaScript has been considered as a 'toy language' is over
and in near feature it will shine not only in browsers but in many other areas.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, the best recommendation for a programmer is his or her code,
so I will kindly ask you take a look at my last open source project that lives <a href="https://github.com/yushchenko/formEngine.js" title="FormEngine.js - an easy way to create complex data driven apps">here on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>My CV is located <a href="/cv" title="CV in HTML format">here</a>.
You can download it in a convenient format
using the following links: <a href="/files/valery_yushchenko_cv.doc" title="CV in Microsoft Word format">doc</a>, <a href="/files/valery_yushchenko_cv.pdf" title="CV in pdf format">pdf</a>, <a href="/files/valery_yushchenko_cv.odt" title="CV in Open Office Writer format">odt</a>.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours, <br />
