<h3>Hi!</h3>
<p>My name is Valery Yushchenko. I live in Kiev (Ukraine)
and share my time between favorite work as a software developer,
studing, surfing Web, reading books, training in the gym and walking or biking around the city.</p>
<p>I've created this site to share writings and have some fun playing with web technologies.
All site's source code is open and located <a href="http://github.com/yushchenko/site">here on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, suggestions and so on, you can find my contact details below.</p>
