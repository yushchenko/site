<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In building site, as in any other business, it's hard to start from the blank page.
It's much easier to make the first step if it's very shourt.
What can be simplier than a site with only one text page?
On the other hand, the first step should be done in the right direction
so the page will contain well formed HTML code generated by Django template
and styled with separate CSS style sheet.</p>
<h3>URLs</h3>
<p>As according the old russian proverb a theater starts from the wardrobe, as a site starts from its URL.</p>
<p>First of all, the address should be as short as it possible, so own domain name is required.
Having spent a couple of hours for investigations, I decided to use <a href="http://www.name.com" title="Name.com web site">name.com</a>.
I liked their relatively simple and fast site and also 'bike-to-work incentive program'
described in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name.com" title="Wiki article about name.com">the wikipedia article</a>.
Our decisions are sometimes driven by strange motives, arn't they?</p>
<p>Next, the resource part of the URL should be short and verbose.
For example, link to this article should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>site.name/blog/site-from-scratch-1-the-first-page
</code></pre>
<p>Short, helps to understand where we are now and even not so hard to type.</p>
<p>The connection between nice url and application's code is usually called 'URL routing'.
For <a href="http://appengine.google.com/" title="Google App Engine">Google App Engine</a> it can be configured either in <code>app.yaml</code> configuration file or
in webapp framework configuration.
The simplest routing contains just two lines of code:</p>
<pre><code>- url: /.*                # take any request to the site
  script: main.py         # and run code from main.py to generate response
</code></pre>
<p>At the begining of the <code>app.yaml</code> should be description of owr app:</p>
<pre><code>application: site
version: 1
</code></pre>
<p>and its runtime:</p>
<pre><code>runtime: python
api_version: 1
</code></pre>
<p>At this stage basic configuration is done
and the site's ready to respond on incoming requests executing code in <code>main.py</code>
so it's a nice time to proceed with the next step.</p>
<h3>Markup Generation</h3>
<p><code>main.py</code> file contains the simple Python code:</p>
<pre><code>print 'Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8'   # let the browser know that it's getting html
print ''
print 'Hello, world!'              # return response content - the text itself
</code></pre>
