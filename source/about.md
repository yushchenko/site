### Hi!

My name is Valery Yushchenko. I live in Kiev (Ukraine)
and share my time between favorite work as a software developer,
studing, surfing Web, reading books, training in the gym and walking or biking around the city.

I've created this site to share writings and have some fun playing with web technologies.
All site's source code is open and located [here on GitHub](http://github.com/yushchenko/site).

If you have any questions, suggestions and so on, you can find my contact details below.
